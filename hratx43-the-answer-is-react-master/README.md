# This section of the Three Mile Island nuclear power facility melted down in 1979.

## Objectives

 - Understand how to implement conditional rendering
 - Apply nested components
 - Perform external API requests
 - Use react life-cycle method: ComponentDidMount

## Getting started

In this sprint, you'll be completing an application that may or may not ressemble a popular game show!

 - *Initial setup:* `npm install`
 
 - *Run the app:* In a new terminal tab, start the application with `npm start`

 - *Run the test suite:* `npm test`
 
 - Make sure you `add` and `commit` frequently!


**Minimum Requirements:**

 - Make all tests pass

 - Make sure you complete all of the user stories (not everything is covered by the test suite!)

 - Look at the style.css and assign the appropriate classes/id's to the components
 
**Advanced Content:**

 - Refactor your asyncronous code to use [promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)
 
 - Implement buzz-in local multiplayer with multiple scoreboards.
 
 - Add CSS animations to handle the transitions between conditional renderings
 
 - Devise a way for a user to request all the clues from a particular day
 
 - Then, add the ability to request clues from categories
 
 - Create a replay feature to capture the most exciting moments of your multiplayer games.
 
 - Use [redux](https://redux.js.org/) to manage application state.


## Application Overview

Below is a flow chart that illustrates how the components in this application are connected.

Please note how some components are nested in other components. Your data should also flow in the direction of the arrows,from parent to child.
